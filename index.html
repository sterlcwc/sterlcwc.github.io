  <h4>Bio</h4>
  <p>
  I'm a fifth-year PhD Candidate in Information Science at Cornell University, where I am extremely fortunate to be co-advised by <a href = "https://sociology.cornell.edu/michael-macy" target = "_blank">Professor Michael Macy</a> 
    and <a href = "https://mmoorr.github.io/www_personal/" target = "_blank">Professor Mor Naaman</a>. 
    I am a member of Professor Macy's <a href = "https://sdl.as.cornell.edu" target = "_blank">Social Dynamics Lab</a> 
    and Professor Naaman's <a href = "https://s.tech.cornell.edu" target = "_blank">Social Technologies Lab.</a> I will be going on the academic job market in 2026.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interests are in psychological effects of our interactions with AI, such as persuasion and reinforcement of false beliefs. 
    In two representative examples of my work, I have shown that biased AI-generated suggestions during the writing process can influence people's attitudes about societal issues (in press at Science Advances), and that anthropomorphic design features in AI chatbots can strengthen belief in a sexist stereotype in politically conservative women (under submission). 
    My work has shown evidence of policy impact, with one of my papers being cited in NATO's 2024-2025 Science & Technology Macro Trends Report <a href = "https://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/news_234507.htm?" target = "_blank">(linked here)</a>. My work has also received attention from the media, such as Gary Marcus in his Substack for over 85k subscribers <a href = "https://garymarcus.substack.com/p/elon-musks-terrifying-vision-for?r=8tdk6&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&triedRedirect=true" target = "_blank">(linked here)</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I enjoy disseminating my research through public speaking. I have been invited to present my research as a distinguished speaker at several university-wide events, such as the Cornell Ivy+ Deans Conference, the Cornell Board of Trustees, the Cornell Trustee Council Annual Meeting, and the Innovation Meets Impact Showcase at Cornell Tech. 
    In March 2024, I won 2nd Place in Cornell University's 3 Minute Thesis Competition. 
    I have also been fortunate to present my research at several conferences, including APS (Association for Psychological Science), SPSP (Society for Personality and Social Psychology), INFORMS, and SRCD (Society for Research in Child Development). 
    Most recently, I was chosen as one of two PhD students from Cornell to present cutting-edge AI research at the 2025 International Advisory Board for Graduate Studies in Hong Kong. 
  </p>

  <p>
  I received my B.A. in Social Psychology along with a B.A. in the Robert S. Harrison College Scholar program (also at Cornell) in 2021, with formal minors in Information Science and Communication. I was honored as a Summa cum Laude graduate, a Merrill Presidential Scholar (the top 1% of my graduating class) and a Phi Beta Kappa inductee.</b> In my graduate studies, I have been fortunate to receive exceptional mentorship from both of my coadvisors and many other professors along the way, 
    which I enjoy paying forward by mentoring other students. As hobbies, I enjoy outdoor long-distance running, baking, and learning new coding languages (my favorite is R).
